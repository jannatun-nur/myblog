          1. A Thirsty Crow
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-800 font-serif py-4 text-xs lg:text-2xl">
          Once upon a time, in a quiet and sun-drenched countryside, a thirsty
          crow was desperately searching for water. The scorching summer sun had
          dried up most of the water sources, and the parched land offered
          little relief. The crow had been flying for hours, its throat dry and
          its energy waning, when it finally spotted a glimmering pot near a
          farmer's house.With a surge of hope, the crow swooped down to
          investigate. As it perched on the edge of the pot, it peered inside
          and saw a small amount of water at the bottom. However, the pot was
          deep, and the water level was too low for the crow to reach with its
          beak. The crow tried tilting the pot, but it was too heavy to
          move.Feeling frustrated but determined, the crow paused to think. It
          remembered a story its mother had once told about using pebbles to
          solve problems. Looking around, the crow noticed a scattering of small
          stones nearby. An idea sparked in its mind.The crow picked up a pebble
          in its beak and dropped it into the pot. It watched eagerly as the
          pebble sank to the bottom, causing the water level to rise slightly.
          Encouraged, the crow repeated the process, picking up pebbles one by
          one and dropping them into the pot. With each pebble, the water level
          inched higher and higher.It was tiring work, but the crow was
          relentless. As the sun climbed higher in the sky, the water slowly
          rose to a level where the crow could finally reach it. With great
          relief, the crow dipped its beak into the pot and drank deeply,
          savoring the cool, refreshing water. The crow's persistence had paid
          off, and it felt a renewed sense of strength and satisfaction.

          2. A Hare & A Tortoise
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-800 font-serif py-4 text-xs lg:text-2xl">
          Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, a hare and a tortoise lived
          among a community of animals. The hare was known for his swiftness and
          agility, often boasting about how he was the fastest animal in the
          forest. The tortoise, on the other hand, was slow but steady, known
          for his patience and perseverance.One day, tired of the hare's
          incessant bragging, the tortoise decided to challenge him to a race.
          Amused by the idea, the hare laughed and agreed, confident that he
          would easily win. The other animals gathered to watch this unlikely
          race, curious to see the outcome.The starting line was drawn, and the
          finish line was set at a large oak tree at the other end of the
          meadow. With a signal from the wise old owl, the race began. As
          expected, the hare sprinted off quickly, leaving the tortoise far
          behind. Certain of his victory, the hare decided to take a nap halfway
          through the race. He found a shady spot under a tree and dozed off,
          thinking he had plenty of time to finish the race later.Meanwhile, the
          tortoise continued to plod along steadily, never stopping or getting
          distracted. He moved at his own slow pace but with unwavering
          determination. The other animals watched in amazement as the tortoise
          kept going, step by step, inching closer to the finish line.After a
          while, the hare woke up from his nap and looked around. To his shock,
          he saw the tortoise very close to the finish line. Panicking, the hare
          leaped up and dashed towards the oak tree with all his speed. However,
          it was too late. Just as the hare was about to overtake him, the
          tortoise crossed the finish line.The forest erupted in cheers for the
          tortoise, who had won the race .

          3. Woodcutter & A Marmaid
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-800 font-serif py-4 text-xs lg:text-2xl">
          Once upon a time, in a dense forest near a quaint village, there lived
          a humble woodcutter named Peter. Peter was an honest and hardworking
          man who earned his living by cutting trees and selling the wood in the
          village market. Despite his modest means, he was content with his
          life, valuing honesty and integrity above all else.One day, while
          chopping wood near a river, Peter’s old axe slipped from his grip and
          fell into the deep water. The river was fast and deep, and Peter
          couldn’t swim well enough to retrieve his only means of livelihood.
          Distraught, he sat by the riverbank, lamenting his misfortune. Without
          his axe, he wouldn’t be able to earn money to support his family.As
          Peter sat there, a shimmering light emerged from the river, and a
          beautiful fairy appeared. "Why are you so sad, dear woodcutter?" she
          asked gently.Peter explained his predicament, and the fairy, moved by
          his honesty and despair, decided to help him. "Do not worry," she
          said, "I will retrieve your axe for you."The fairy dove into the river
          and soon emerged with a gleaming golden axe. "Is this your axe?" she
          asked.Peter looked at the magnificent axe but shook his head. "No,
          that is not my axe," he replied. "Mine was a simple, old iron axe."The
          fairy smiled and dove into the river again. This time, she brought up
          a silver axe. "Is this your axe?" she inquired.Peter, though tempted
          by the beauty of the silver axe, again shook his head. "No, that is
          not my axe either," he said. "Mine was just a plain iron axe."The
          fairy nodded approvingly and once more dove into the river. When she
          emerged this time, she held Peter’s old, iron axe. "Is this your axe?"
          she asked.Peter’s face lit up with joy. "Yes, that is my axe! Thank
          you so much!"Impressed by Peter’s honesty, the fairy decided to reward
          him. "Because you were truthful and did not claim the gold or silver
          axes, I will give you all three axes," she said with a smile. "Your
          honesty and integrity deserve to be rewarded."Peter couldn’t believe
          his luck. He gratefully accepted the axes and thanked the fairy
          profusely. He returned to the village with the golden, silver, and
          iron axes, and his story quickly spread. The villagers admired Peter’s
          honesty and the blessings it had brought him.From that day on, Peter
          lived a prosperous life, not because of the wealth the axes brought
          him, but because of the respect and trust he earned from the
          villagers. He continued to work hard and remained the honest, humble
          man he had always been, never forgetting the lesson of the fairy’s
          reward.

          4. A Liar Cowboy
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-800 font-serif py-4 text-xs lg:text-2xl">
          Once upon a time, in a small, dusty town on the edge of the Wild West,
          there lived a young cowboy named Billy. Billy was known throughout the
          town not for his skills with a lasso or his bravery in facing outlaws,
          but for his tendency to stretch the truth. He loved to tell tall tales
          and often exaggerated his adventures, much to the amusement and,
          eventually, annoyance of the townsfolk.One hot afternoon, Billy was
          lounging in the town square, spinning yet another yarn about how he
          had single-handedly outwitted a band of ruthless outlaws. The
          townspeople, though entertained at first, began to grow weary of his
          lies. They had heard too many of Billy's fabrications and started to
          doubt anything he said.One day, while Billy was out tending to his
          cattle on the outskirts of town, he grew bored and decided to play a
          trick. Climbing onto a large rock, he began shouting, "Help! Help! A
          wolf is attacking the herd!" He repeated his cries, making them as
          loud and desperate as he could.Hearing his frantic shouts, the
          townsfolk dropped what they were doing and rushed to his aid, armed
          with pitchforks, rifles, and whatever they could find. But when they
          arrived at the pasture, they found Billy laughing heartily, without a
          wolf in sight. "You should have seen your faces!" he chuckled.The
          townspeople were not amused. They grumbled and returned to town,
          annoyed that they had been fooled. Billy, however, found the whole
          episode hilarious and enjoyed the attention his prank had brought
          him.A few days later, Billy decided to pull the same trick again. He
          climbed the same rock and shouted, "Help! Help! A wolf is attacking
          the herd!" Once more, the townsfolk ran to his aid, only to find Billy
          laughing even harder than before. This time, they were furious. "You
          won't find us coming to help you again, Billy," they warned. "We have
          more important things to do than to chase after your lies."Billy
          shrugged off their anger, thinking it was all in good fun. But one
          evening, as the sun was setting, a real wolf appeared at the edge of
          the pasture. Seeing the wolf approach his cattle, Billy's heart raced
          with genuine fear. He climbed the rock and shouted with all his might,
          "Help! Help! A wolf is attacking the herd! This time it's real!"But
          this time, no one came. The townsfolk, having been fooled twice
          before, ignored his cries, thinking it was just another one of Billy's
          tricks. Desperate, Billy kept shouting and waving, but it was no use.
          The wolf attacked his herd, and Billy could do nothing to stop it.

          5. Two friends & A Bear
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-800 font-serif py-4 text-xs lg:text-2xl">
          Once upon a time, in a serene village nestled between rolling hills
          and dense forests, lived two friends named John and Sam. John and Sam
          were inseparable; they had grown up together and shared countless
          adventures. Despite their different personalities—John was brave and
          adventurous, while Sam was cautious and thoughtful—they complemented
          each other perfectly.One sunny day, the two friends decided to go on a
          journey through the forest to explore a new area they had heard about.
          As they walked along the winding trails, they laughed and talked,
          enjoying the beauty of nature around them. They were so engrossed in
          their conversation that they didn't notice the sun starting to set,
          casting long shadows over the forest floor.Suddenly, they heard a
          rustling noise in the bushes ahead. They stopped in their tracks,
          their hearts pounding. Out of the thicket emerged a large, ferocious
          bear. The bear stood on its hind legs, roaring loudly, clearly
          agitated by their presence.John, thinking quickly, climbed up the
          nearest tree. He had always been good at climbing and knew he could
          escape the bear's reach this way. Sam, however, was not as adept at
          climbing and found himself frozen with fear. Seeing no other option,
          Sam remembered an old piece of advice: bears often leave motionless
          people alone. He dropped to the ground and lay still, holding his
          breath and pretending to be dead.The bear approached Sam, sniffing
          around him. It nudged him a few times with its snout, but Sam remained
          perfectly still. After a tense few moments, the bear lost interest and
          lumbered away, disappearing back into the forest.When the coast was
          clear, John climbed down from the tree. He rushed over to Sam, who was
          still lying on the ground, and helped him to his feet. "Are you okay?"
          John asked, his voice trembling with concern.Sam nodded, brushing off
          the dirt from his clothes. "I'm fine, thanks to that old advice. But I
          have to ask you something, John.""When the bear was sniffing around
          me," Sam said, "it looked like it was whispering something in my ear.
          What do you think it was saying?".Jhon smiled and said the bear was
          telling me not to trust anyone those who leave in danger.
