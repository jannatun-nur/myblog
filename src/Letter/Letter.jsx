        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-800 font-serif py-4 text-xs lg:text-xl">
          Dear Ayaash,
          <br />I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to
          thank you for the wonderful birthday present you gave me. Your
          thoughtfulness truly made my day special, and I couldn't be more
          grateful.The book of Shakespeare is absolutely perfect. It’s clear
          that you put a lot of thought into choosing something that aligns so
          well with my interests. I've already started reading it, and it’s
          brought me so much joy.Beyond the gift itself, your friendship means a
          lot to me. I feel incredibly lucky to have someone like you in my
          life—someone who understands me and always knows how to make me smile.
          Your support and kindness are things I cherish deeply.
          <br /> Thank you once again for the amazing birthday present and for
          being such an important part of my life. I’m looking forward to our
          next get-together and making more great memories together.
          <br /> Take care and see you soon!
          <br /> Warmest regards,
          <br />
          Mahat.

          Dear Amartya,
          <br />I hope this letter finds you in good spirits. I wanted to share
          with you my recent visit to Taaj Mahal, and I think you’d find it as
          fascinating as I did!
          <br /> Last weekend, I had the opportunity to explore Taaj Mahal of
          Delhi, and it was an incredible experience. From the moment I arrived,
          I was captivated by the sheer history and beauty of the site. The
          features, e.g., architecture, artifacts, gardens were absolutely
          stunning and transported me back in time.One of the highlights of the
          visit was the grave of Mamtaaj. Standing in front of it, I couldn’t
          help but feel a deep sense of awe and respect for the people who built
          it and the stories it holds. The guided tour was incredibly
          informative, and I learned so much about the taaj mahal's
          significance, cultural impact, notable events associated with the
          place.I think you’d love exploring the work of marble of taaj mahal
          and delving into the rich history of the area.
          <br />I hope we can catch up soon and make some plans for our next
          adventure. Until then, take care and let’s stay in touch!
          <br />
          Best wishes,
          <br />
          Subaash.

          Dear Mohuaa,
          <br />I was so sorry to hear that you’ve been feeling unwell lately. I
          wanted to write and let you know that I’m thinking of you and wishing
          you a speedy recovery.
          <br />I can’t imagine how tough it must be to deal with chicken fox,
          but I know you’re strong and resilient. I have no doubt that you’ll
          come through this with flying colors. In the meantime, please remember
          to take it easy and give yourself the rest and care you need to heal.I
          also wanted to share a little something to hopefully brighten your
          day. Remember that time when you help me in during my bad time?
          Thinking back on that always makes me smile, and I hope it brings a
          smile to your face too. We have so many more good times ahead of us,
          and I’m looking forward to creating more wonderful memories together
          once you’re back on your feet.
          <br />
          Take all the time you need to rest and recover. Your health and
          well-being are the most important things right now. I’ll be checking
          in on you, but until then, get plenty of rest and know that you’re in
          my thoughts.
          <br/>Get well soon, my friend. I’m sending you all my best wishes and positive energy.
          <br/>Warmest regards,
